# Rishi Guptha Mankala Portfolio

## Description

This project is a professional portfolio website built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and leverages several modern web techniques such as CSS transitions, transforms, and the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) for scroll reveal effects. The code is organized into reusable components and custom hooks, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Interesting Techniques

- **Scroll Reveal with Intersection Observer:**  
  Elements become visible as they enter the viewport using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). See [src/hooks/useScrollReveal.tsx](./src/hooks/useScrollReveal.tsx) for details.

- **Parallax Tilt Effect:**  
  The project cards implement a 3D parallax tilt effect on hover using CSS transforms and transitions. Learn more about [CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) and [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition).

- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:**  
  Responsive layouts are achieved using Tailwind’s mobile-first utility classes. This ensures the site adapts smoothly to various screen sizes.

- **Dynamic Theming:**  
  A custom hook manages theme switching between light and dark modes, utilizing CSS variables and the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query.
